          <h3>Which type of space will your Code of Conduct apply to?</h3>
          <p>The context in which your Code of Conduct applies will depend on whether your community is primarily offline or online.</p>
          <p>Examples of offline spaces include conferences, meetups and workshops. Online spaces, including mailing lists, forums and repositories, may also require a Code of Conduct.</p>
          <p>If your community meets both online and offline then it is recommended to have one Code of Conduct across both contexts.</p>

          <h3>Under what circumstances does this Code of Conduct apply?</h3>
          <p>Specifying particular unacceptable behaviour is an aspect of Code of Conduct creation which has faced a lot of discussion. Some oppose it because they see it as futile to try and list all unacceptable behaviours - and it is. That is why it a non-exhaustive list which should clearly state at the start: &quot;Harassment includes, <strong>but is not limited to</strong> the following actions&quot;.</p>
          <p>Replacing such specificity with a catch-all statement of &quot;Don't be a jerk&quot; is problematic - people are rarely intentially unpleasant to each other. By specifying examples of which actions are unacceptable in your community, it becomes clear to all involved that excuses such as &quot;It was a joke&quot; or &quot;I didn&#39;t realise it would be a problem&quot; are not valid.</p>
          <p>It also enables those reporting possible violations to gauge the type of actions which are deemed inappropriate by the organisers and will be taken seriously, should they be reported.</p>
          <p>Are there any additional specific behaviours you wish to explicitly discourage in your Code of Conduct?</p>
