# Code of Conduct builder

## Problem
Current resources for building a Code of Conduct for events and repos are blog posts and copyable policies. Lots of reading lots of opinions (some differing) and lots of things to consider - itâ€™s overwhelming for most people and is a huge task to provide a supportable and well-considered Code of Conduct. Usual solution is to either not have one or to copy and paste an existing one without properly implementing processes to support it. Both are poor solutions that fail to support attendees and can give a false sense of security to them.

## Goal
To make the process of creating a Code of Conduct more efficient, while encouraging users to think about the processes they need to put in place to support it. Users should be educated primarily about the need for a Code of Conduct but also on methods of encouraging diversity at their event or repo.

### Functionality priorities
1. Interactive tool for building a Code of Conduct for an event
2. Educate users on the need for a Code of Conduct
3. Interactive tool for building a Code of Conduct for an open-source repository
4. Educate users on methods of encouraging diversity
5. Additional resources for self-education and list of events/repos which have used this tool

### Tasks
- [x] Define problem, goal, solution priorities and tasks
- [ ] Compile list of resources and categorise by:
  * tool (elements to include in a Code of Conduct)
  * education (reasons behind a Code of Conduct and diversification beyond that)
  * event
  * project
