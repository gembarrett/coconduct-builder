## User stories
As a conference organiser who has implemented a Code of Conduct before, I want to learn how to build a more diverse environment at my conference.

As an open-source project owner who also runs events for the same community, I want to create a single Code of Conduct that applies to my commmunity's online and offline spaces.

As an event attendee, I want to easily share a collection of well-considered, community-supported practices with event organisers.

As an open-source contributor, I want to know that the project I'm involved with has considered the processes it needs to put in place to support the Code of Conduct.

As an open-source project owner, I want to build a well-considered Code of Conduct that is customised to my project.

As a forum admin, I want to access a Code of Conduct resource which brings together a lot of the community-supported advice and tips provided in various blog posts.
